# Particle system

An interesting project using the interoperability between OpenGL and OpenCL to simulate particles orbiting around a gravity point.

The gravity point follow the mouse cursor.

* You can disable the gravity with `G`.
* Change the colors with ⬆️ and ⬇️.
* Switch between initialization shapes with ⬅️ and ➡️.
* Freely navigate inside the scene by pressing `Tab` and using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `C`, and the spacebar to move around (you can hold `Shift` to go faster).
* Pause the movement with the spacebar if you are not in free navigation mode or `P`.
